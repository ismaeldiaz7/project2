	<p> Now before I get raided by little kids, receive backlash from teenagers, and parents disagreeing. Hear me out, please.
	We all know Disney is loved worldwide. But there are some people who tend to dislike Disney or Disney movies and thinks the hype for it is unnecessary. But personally, I think Disneyland is OVERHYPED and OVERRATED. I highly encourage you don't spend a dime or even consider going there for your next trip. Click the Con's page to see why.</p>

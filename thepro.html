		<h1> Pro's About Disneyland </h1>
				<h3 class="personalexperience">Personal Experiences</h3>
			<p> Now after you guys are pretty heated or irritated at the fact that I said it was overrated and having your view of me hating it. Stop, listen when I say this. Not everything about Disneyland is all bad. Sure there are great deals there and everyone is so friendly including staff. From my personal experience, one time I was short by a dollar or two to buy one of their turkey leg over at the Frontier-land, I already took a bite out of legs so I couldn't return it. But the person who sold it to me said "I'll pay for it out of my wallet, don't worry". I was in shock if I was being honest. On-top of that, if you are a staff, I believe you get discounts for the tickets as well as free tickets and able to bring two people along, plus for annual passes you get discounts for all the food, merchants, and photos. Including getting free parking but only for the most expensive pass. And every pass is different.</p>
				<h3 class="employeeadvantages">Employees advantages</h3>
			<p> By law, the minimum wage for California is currently 11 dollars per hour, and the a average Disney employee earns the minimum. Disneyland raised their pay wage up by 20% so they are paid $13.50 per hour. On top of that, the minimum wage is going to be raised by 4 dolors so it'll be 15 dolors plus the 20% from working at Disney $18 will be their minimum.

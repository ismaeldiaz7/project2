			<p class="inset">What I want everyone to do is to. SPEND. YOUR. MONEY. ELSEWHERE. It's seriously isn't worth the hype neither the wait if majority of the time, you're standing in a line that could take hours to even get close to it. On top of that, majority of the rides are old so they can easily break down and some of the main attraction and hyped rides are the ones that are typically closed.</p>

			<p class="inset"> Take my advice and spend your money on either Six Flags or Knotts Berry Farm. Knotts doesn't have an over drastically waiting time for all of their rides. Six flags have more intense rides they are worth the waiting time and don't disappoint. Plus, the money is worth it and they both have better holiday events besides Christmas. To top it all off, both parks have cheaper food prices, cheaper items at shops, and multiple of shows and entertainments that are fun for the family for a much cheaper price.</p>
